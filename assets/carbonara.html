            This recipe is so easy to make, it only uses 5 ingredients! However, there is a bit of technique needed with the egg in order to make sure it is cooked at the perfect, creamy consistency.
            The proper cheese is essential as well, and carbonara afficianados will say that only two are allowed.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz Guanciale (Pancetta is a common substitute, but then you <strong>WILL NEED OLIVE OIL</strong> since it doesnt have enough fat)</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Pecorino Romano (can be substitued for <strong>REAL</strong> Parmigiano Reggiano)</li>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The first thing you should do is cube up your guanciale. You want this to be super small, so it may take some time. However, the small size creates a texture that is <em>essential</em>, so don't give up!</li>
            <li>Then you should do is cook your pasta. It just takes about 6-7 minutes in boiling water to cook premade spaghetti al denti.</li>
            <li>Next, cook your guanciale until it is nice golden and crispy. It should practically look how you'd want bacon to look in terms of color</li>
            <li>After your guanciale looks good, make sure your pasta is drained and rinsed with cold water to stop it from cooking. Save a ladle of the pasta water</li>
            <li>Here you will add your fresh grated cheese to your guanciale/pasta mix. It's important that you grate it and don't buy it pre-shredded, as the quality of pre-shredded cheese is extremely inferior.</li>
            <li>This step is very important, mix up the egg and add it to the pan and cook it on <strong>LOW OR NO HEAT</strong>. This is so that the egg stays creamy while simultaneously cooking it. The heat from everything might be hot enough for this so you may be able to turn the heat off. If it's too high your egg will cook like a scrambled egg.</li>
            <li>Lastly but not to be ignored, add fresh ground black pepper. Fresh ground rainbow peppercorns are nice too, but ultimately <strong>fresh ground</strong> is the important thing here.</li>
        </ol>
