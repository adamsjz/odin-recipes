            Also known as a mexican, slow roasted and shredded pork plate, carnitas is probably my all time favorite comfort food. Traditionally cooked in its own fat for multiple hours, I add a few ingredients
            to bring out some extra flavors of the pork shoulder. Be warned <strong>some traditionalists will not consider this Carnitas and I am in no position to argue nor disagree with them</strong>. That being said, it definitely is something inspired by the lovely
            mexican dish that essentialy is an homage to, if not, the true thing. For this recipe I am using my dutch oven on a gas stove, so cooking times and temperatures may vary. That being said, this can be done 
            in any large pot, on a gas or electric stove or in an oven, or even in a slow cooker.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork Shoulder/Butt (Butt is another name for the shoulder).</li>
            <li>6 oz Orange juice (I use simply orange mango because I think it adds a little extra flavor)</li>
            <li>A whole onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic (I use 5 because I <strong>love</strong> garlic).</li>
            <li>Seasoning blend of your choice (I use salt pepper smoked paprika garlic onion dried cilantro cumin oregano cyanne pepper and chilli pepper)</li>
            <li>Guajillo, Ancho, and Chili de Arbol dried peppers (most likely in the international section in the spanish foods at your local grocery store)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First off <strong>PREP ALL YOUR INGREDIENTS</strong>. Mince your garlic, chop your onion, boil the guajillo, ancho, and chili de arbol peppers until they are soft, then cut off the stems and remove the seeds (please, <strong>do not use more than one chili de arbol if you are new to them</strong> they are small but are very hot, honestly just use one of each pepper and you'll be 100% fine in terms of flavor), season your pork butt, get the orange juiced measured and ready.</li>
            <li>Next off we are going to put some oil in our dutch oven and put it on meduim heat. We then start sauteeing the onions first, and after they get some color we add the garlic (otherwise the garlic will burn before the onion is done). Once the garlic is golden brown and the onions are your preferred texture (I use enough oil so they don't stick, but not enough that they carmelize so that they "grill" a little bit). Turn the stove temperature to the lowest possible setting.</li>
            <li>Making sure that we have our dried peppers boiled, de-stemmed and de-seeded, our garlic and onions sauteed/roasted/grilled and set aside, our pork butt is seasoned, our orange juice is ready, and our stove top is set to the lowest temperature, we are ready for the easiest parts.</li>
            <li>Put the porkbutt in the dutch oven fat cap up (this way the fat drizzles down over all the meat as it cooks).</li>
            <li>Add the peppers and onions and garlic (literally just throw them in there).</li>
            <li>Pour the orange juice (do not worry if it barely covers anything, the melting fat cap creates the liquid that really cooks the carnitas.).</li>
            <li>Close the lid.</li>
            <li>Wait 6-8 hours depending on the size of the pork butt, checking on it every 1-2 hours (I typically do an hour a pound plus thirty minutes).</li>
            <li>You'll know its done when the shoulder bone pops right out, but be advised it is going to be <strong>hot</strong> so use tongs or even gloves to remove it if you aren't used to touching hot things while cooking.</li>
            <li>Take the meat out of the dutch oven and shred it. Again, you will know its done because it should just fall right apart with minimal effort.</li>
            <li><strong>SEPERATE REMAINING SOLIDS FROM THE LIQUIDS, AND FREEZE HALF/SAVE HALF OF THE LIQUIDS</strong>. This is not only what we use to fry the carnitas up in in the next step, but saving some makes it so we can just throw that in with a pork butt next time and not have to do anything else.</li>
            <li>Line a pan with some of the saved carnitas juices on medium-high heat, and fry your preferred serving amount of carnitas <em>just enough</em> for them to get a little bit crispy. The texture is amazing versus just serving them right away.</li>
            <li>You can serve this a number of different ways. I love them as the main protein on a plate with some rice, beans, tortillas, cilantro, onion, and lime. They are also amazing in tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, tortas/sandwiches, omelettes, egg rolls, pizza, and more I can't even think of right now!</li>
        </ol>
