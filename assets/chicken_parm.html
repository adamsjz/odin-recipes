        <h1>Chicken Parmigiana with Homemade Pasta Recipe</h1>

        <p>
            If you've never had chicken parmigiana before (shortened to chicken parm in this recipe from here on out, and in many recipes and menus universally), you are missing out on a simple yet delicious Italian dish.
            A breaded chicken cutlet pan fried in olive oil, then covered in tomato sauce and cheese and baked until the cheese melts, this dish is an instant classic and bound to make you explore other
            Italian dishes if you were previously unfamiliar. Though in Italy you won't see it traditionally served with pasta, American-Italian cusine has been serving this combo for decades, with many (including myself)
            feeling as if the two are inseperable. In this recipe we don't only bread and fry our own cutlet, but we also make our own pasta! It's not necessary, but it makes such a huge difference.
            Essentially, in my opinion, there is no store bought pasta that comes close to any hand made pasta, so if you're willing to do so, it pays off for life. Keep in mind this recipe is made using a pasta machine, so
            if you don't have one I'm sorry!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Pasta</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Wheat flour (I use 00, you can use semolina or even all purpose flour if you want).</li>
            <li>Eggs (try not to use small eggs or you'll be sad you used so many).</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chicken Parm Cutlets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Boneless skinless chicken breasts (I know some stores sell thin cut breasts, but you can just butterfly thick ones over tenderizing them).</li>
            <li>Bread crumbs (you can buy plain ones, italian seasoned ones, you can season the plain ones yourself, or you can make your own, doesnt matter)</li>
            <li>Flour (to coat the chicken in with the bread crumbs).</li>
            <li>Egg (for egg washing the breasts before coating in flour/bread crumbs).</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce (it can be pasta sauce or marinara or even pizza sauce, for this recipe I made my own pasta sauce).</li>
            <li>Cheese (ironically I just use mozerella for this and I'm pretty sure that's what majority of recipes do anyway. It just has a very good meltability and mild flavor).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <h3>Pasta</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, and you're welcome for a real measurement, scoop two cups of flour onto a <strong>CLEAN</strong> flat surface. Form a well/crater with the flour to hold the eggs.</li>
            <li>Next, add two large eggs and 4 large egg yolks to the well. Add in a teaspoon of olive oil, and half a teaspoon of salt.</li>
            <li>This is the hardest part for sure, but with a fork you are going to slowly mix the flour in with the other ingredients. To do this you slowly go around the well pulling the flour into the eggs in a motion similar to reeling in a fish. Just much more gentler. Really make sure you are mixing the flour with the pasta gradually</li>
            <li>Once it becomes too hard to do with a fork, you can start incorporating your hands. This should be towards the end when the pasta dough is nearly fully mixed</li>
            <li>After its mixed we <strong>NEED</strong> to knead it for 10 minutes. Set a timer so you do not cheat. Also make sure to flour your working surface. My favorite method is to make a V going left and right, as it really kneads the different sides of the dough.</li>
            <li>Cut the dough into segments (I try to do 6-8 segments, but the goal is each segment is a serving). Once you have the segments, you can start to roll it out. You can do this without a pasta maker, but it is a lot of work. The pasta needs to be thin since it will absorb water when we cook it, so even thick noodles might be thinner than you'd think.</li>
            <li>Regardless of your rolling method, roll the dough until it is so thin that you can essentially read a newspaper under it. I do the thinnest setting on my pasta machine. As a tip, if your dough is getting uneven, just fold the outside halfs inside to the middle, and roll it out. You want a rectangular shape</li>
            <li>Once the pasta is rolled you can cut it to your preferred shape. My favorite pasta is capellini, so that's why I was going for the super thin</li>
            <li>After cutting it, <strong>FLOUR IT OR IT WILL STICK TOGETHER</strong>. This can be devastating when you go to boil it and it comes out a weird clump.</li>
            <li>Whatever your decided number of servings to boil is, make sure you fill a pot up with enough water to hold it all but not too much to make it overflow. Boil the pasta for roughly 4-6 minutes depending on your thickness.</li>
            <li>Drain the cooked pasta and run cold water over it to stop it from cooking. It will be re-heated when we toss it in the sauce. Save about 2 ounces of the pasta water for this as well.</li>
            <li>To finish, combine in a pan with sauce and the leftover pasta water in a pan on medium low heat. Cook it until steamy, and it's ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Chicken Cutlets</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Assuming you have thin cut breasts, season them to your liking keeping in mind that this is an italian dish (I use salt, pepper, garlic, onion, smoked paprika, and an italian seasoning blend with basil, oregano, and parsely).</li>
            <li>Once seasoned, coat in an egg wash, then toss in a flour/breadcrumb combination (I recommend a little more breadcrumb than flour personally)</li>
            <li>Heat a cast iron skillet to medium heat and fill the bottom with olive oil. Basically enough to have the thin chicken breasts be 1/3 of the way submerged in oil (but if theyre really thin, that shouldnt be a lot of oil). Keep in mind olive oil has a low smoke point, so low and slow is better than fast and disgusting.</li>
            <li>The oil will be ready when it starts to shimmer a bit, so go ahead and toss in the chicken breasts. If you don't hear it start cooking right away, the oil was not ready.</li>
            <li>The chicken should not take long on both sides to get a nice golden brown color as well as fully cooked through, assuming it is thin enough. If your cutlet is too thick, your breading will cook before your chicken. This will lead to the appearance of it being done when the chicken is in fact raw.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is done, place on a foil lined baking sheet and cover with sauce and cheese. Put in an oven preheated to 450 degrees until the cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Plate with the pasta, and its done!</li>
        </ol>
