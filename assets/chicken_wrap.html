        <p>
            If you like breakfast any time of day as well as the flavor of a delicious juicy burger, this recipe is just for you.
            Granted with the addition of a fried egg and apple butter, <strong>this recipe definitely is not for everyone</strong>. However, if you're
            interested in a savory, sweet, overall delicious burger that goes above and beyond restauraunt quality, this <em>might</em> be the
            burger for you.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef (preferably 80/20)</li>
            <li>Brioche Buns</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Cheese (I use havarti, provolone, or American)</li>
            <li>Burger seasoning of your choice (I combine salt pepper garlic onion smoked paprika brown sugar and chili pepper</li>
            <li>Fried egg (I definitely prefer runny but yours doesn't have to be)</li>
            <li>Apple butter (its essentially a fruit spread and has no butter/dairy in it. can find in stores.)</li>
            <li>Condiments of choice (I always do ketchup <strong>KEWPIE</strong> mayo pickles lettuce and onion, <strong>never tomato for me!</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The first thing you want to do is PREP everything. Make sure your veggies are cut. Measure out your patty size and season it. Preheat your pans. Get your bun ready for everything.
                This will save you time later on when you are ready to start chowing down!</li>
            <li>Start cooking that bacon. The trick here is that we want to use the bacon grease to cook the egg AND the burger. You can cook it in the oven to better preserve the grease, but
                overall the important thing is don't go it fast and hot, it will get smokey and the bacon will burn</li>
            <li>Once the bacon is done set it on your bun and get to cooking your burger and egg. I do these in two seperate pans at the same time, starting the burgers a little bit earlier since the eggs cook faster</li>
            <li>After cooking the burger for 3 minutes on each side it should be a little pink in the middle but done (do 4 minutes each side for no pink) assuming you are cooking on medium high heat. The egg will take maybe 2-3 minutes for a runny egg, 4 minutes for a more solid yolk.</li>
            <li>Put the egg and burger on the bun with the bacon, and assuming all your condiments were all prepared and placed on the bun before hand, you just have to put the top bun on, and dig in!</li>
        </ol>
