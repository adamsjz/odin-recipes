        <p>Hello everyone, especially those from the Odin Project, to my recipe site! This is a project associated with the
            Odin Project's introductory course regarding HTML pages, various elements and tags within them, as well as using git to update all the changes.
        </p>
        <h2>The Recipes</h2>
        <p>All the recipes and photos you see are actually of my food! Since food is one of my biggest passions, I thought it would be a great idea to use this project to actually write out some of my own recipes.
            I thought this would be a nice little personal touch to the project, and that it additonally might give me a fun extra challenge of having to organize all of my own material much like a real website.
            These are a good variety of dishes that I make regularly, and maybe might be some you wind up making regularly as well!
        </p>
        <h2>**Disclaimer**</h2>
        <p>I have to be fully honest in saying that I do <strong>NOT</strong> measure anything! I typically make enough to serve 3 but I truly eye ball everything when I cook.
        This is understandably chaotic for some, but in general if you can sort of figure out measurings that work for you, I guarantee you will love these dishes as much as I
        (and everyone who has eaten them) do.
